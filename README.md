# DEPI-PROJECT_MTA Daily Ridership Analysis
# Overview
This project aims to analyze MTA daily ridership data to identify trends in subway, bus, and commuter rail usage. The goal is to assess ridership recovery post-pandemic, understand peak travel times, and explore factors affecting transit usage. The dataset includes daily ridership counts for subways, buses, railroads, and bridges/tunnels, along with percentage comparisons to pre-pandemic levels.

# Objectives
Identify peak ridership hours for different transportation modes.

Analyze subway, bus, and commuter rail ridership trends over time.

Compare current ridership to pre-pandemic levels to assess recovery.

Evaluate the impact of external factors (e.g., COVID-19, weather, economy) on ridership.

Provide actionable insights for transportation planning and policy-making.
